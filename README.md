FreeBSD GEOM class for Solaris x86 disk labels

I wrote it in 2005 when Solaris Express was available. I was running
FreeBSD on my desktop back then, and even though Solaris was handling
UFS, my FreeBSD couldn't mount its partitions (labels).

This class was the solution. I haven't found any other testers (but myself)
and I never checked it in to the FreeBSD.

I'm publishing it on Github in hope someone else finds it helpful.

Unless otherwise stated, everything in this project is available on
BSD v2 license.
